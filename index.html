    <p class = "paragraphAbout">I'm 21 years old and I'm studying Computer Engineering at the University of São Paulo, I'm currently looking to become a fullstack developer for my formation until I decide on a specialization. I want to learn software architecture in the future so that I can have a complete knowledge.</p>

  <p class = "paragraphAbout">I have been interested in computers and programming since an early age, to the point of having my first contact with HTML at 11 when I tried to make a blog (using blogspot) to share my interests about a game I really liked (Brasfoot). However, I did not go back to study and returned to my interest in programming in 2019 when I had my first contact with Java, where I learned the structure of object-oriented programming and some data structures and algorithms.</p>
      
  <p class = "paragraphAbout">In 2020 I dedicated my studies to the possibility of becoming a data scientist and therefore I learned Python and gained knowledge of databases with some Coursera courses. But I realized that it was not exactly what I was looking for and in 2021 I returned to my studies to front-end development, I learned HTML, CSS and Javascript. I also started my contact with ReactJS and I am improving my skills in this framework due to its high capacity and use by several companies. At the moment besides ReactJS I'm learning NodeJS for the backend</p>>
      
  <p class = "paragraphAbout">In addition to computing, I love mathematics and physics, I go deeper only as a hobby and self-interest. I'm also a football lover, supporting São Paulo and Manchester City, I was a bassist in a band in high school and I'm currently learning to play the guitar. 
      </p>      
  <p class = "paragraphAbout">That's me</p>
